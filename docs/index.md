This site is a collection of notes and extra materials associated with CCE 270 at Brigham Young University. CCE 
270 is now taught in Python and the course content can be found here:

[BYU CCE 270 - Computational Methods](https://byu-cce270.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Prior to switching to Python, this course was taught in Microsoft Excel using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). 
The Excel VBA Primer is a collection of notes and extra materials associated with CCE 270 when the primary programming language was Excel VBA. The VBA Primer is
essentially an online textbook where each chapter is designed to supplement one of the class lectures. It can also 
be used as an independent resource for learning how to program in Excel using Visual Basic for Application (VBA). I 
maintain the VBA Primer for people who are interested in learning how to program in Excel using VBA. 

This primer is divided into three main sections:

| Section | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Excel Fundamentals | Basic features of Microsoft Excel that are useful in engineering applications. |
| VBA Fundamentals | Basic features of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) programming. |
| Advanced VBA | Advanced topics in VBA programming. |

There is also a [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@excelvbaprimer) associated with this primer. It includes 
videos for a set of exercises associated with the VBA Primer content. The video playlists are organized in the same 
fashion as the VBA Primer table of contents.

Please use the table of contents on the left to navigate through topics in each section.
